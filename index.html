          <h2>Las Vegas</h2>
          <p>The very first time I went to Las Vegas is a time that I would never be able to remember. I was only 2 years old. My family and grandparents took a plane to Vegas and wheeled me around in a stroller everywhere they went. The next time I had the priveldge of visiting Vegas was when I was 8 years old. My grandparents took my sister and I all by themselves and we had an amazing time. We got to see different shows on the strip and stayed in Caesars Palace. The Strip was absolutely beautiful and the trip was all around amazing. </p>

          <h2>Yellowstone</h2>
          <p>My grandparents favorite place to travel is by far Yellowstone. They take trips there every chance they get. Ever since I turned 6, my grandparents have taken me and my sister along with on their trips. I've visited Yellowstone about 5 times and stayed for around a week each visit. One of my favorite things to see in Yellowstone was Old Faithful. Old Faithful is a geyser that shoots water out of the ground around 150 feet high.</p>

          <h2>Canada</h2>
          <p>When I turned 12, my grandparents decided to take us back to Canada for a second time, since we had only traveled through it to get somewhere(which is what the next section is about). We got the experience of taking a day long boat trip to see the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. We also were able to visit the Titanic museum in Halifax Nova Scotia. One of the best parts of the trip though, was getting to see a recreation of a viking villiage (L'Anse aux Meadows) and listen to stories in a hut from an actor.</p>

          <a name="Alaska"></a>
          <h2>Alaska</h2>
          <p>My favorite vacation of all time comes from when I was 10 years old. My grandparents took us kids on a 3 month vaction by car to ALASKA!!! We taveled all the way through Canada for about 2 weeks, stayed in Alaska for around 2 months, and traveled back through Canada and home for about 2 weeks. Needless to say by the end of the trip I was extreamely homesick, but I wouldn't trade the experiance for anything. We got to see places like Nome, Denali, Anchorage, Fairbanks, and all sorts of other amazing places. We got to see everything like glaciers, whales, rare birds, the northern lights, people panning for gold, etc. We even got to travel to a small native villiage by taking a very small plane across a frozen lake, that when it is entirely frozen hosts a huge dogsled race. My favorite part of the trip was when, we were on a ferry boat and there were tons of people out with their huge expensive cameras trying to get pictures of a whale surfacing. While this was happening my grandmother gave me her camera so she could go look for my sister. I pointed the camera where I assumed the whale would surface and it was exactly where I expected it to be. I snapped as many pictures as I could and was able to capture the entire process so well that you could see the barnacles on the whale's tail and all of the other photographers were jealous of my pictures.</p>
